# Code the Beat - Complete Application Flow & Architecture Description

## Overview
Code the Beat is a rhythm-based coding game built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It combines programming challenges with musical timing, creating an engaging educational experience where players solve coding problems in sync with musical beats.

## Core Technologies
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7.0.3
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with dark/light theme support
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth UI transitions
- **Audio**: Tone.js for rhythm generation and sound synthesis
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- **Backend**: Supabase for leaderboards and data persistence
- **State Management**: React Context API with hooks
- **Code Analysis**: Babel parser for AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) validation

## Application Architecture

### 1. Entry Point & Context Setup (main.tsx)
```
Application Root
├── ThemeProvider (theme management)
└── AchievementsProvider (achievement system)
    └── App (main application component)
```

The application initializes with two main context providers:
- **ThemeProvider**: Manages dark/light theme switching
- **AchievementsProvider**: Handles achievement system, player statistics, and scoring

### 2. Main Application Component (App.tsx)
The App component serves as the central hub, managing:
- **Game State**: Current level, challenge, score, streak, playing status
- **UI State**: Modal visibility, language selection, achievement notifications
- **Event Handling**: Game controls, user interactions, achievement triggers

#### Key State Variables:
- `gameState`: Core game state (level, challenge, score, streak, etc.)
- `selectedLanguage`: Currently selected programming language
- `showLevelSelector`, `showLeaderboard`, etc.: Modal visibility flags
- `newAchievement`: Currently displayed achievement notification
- `shownAchievements`: Tracks which achievements have been shown to prevent duplicates

### 3. Game Engine (useMultiLanguageGameEngine.ts)
The core game logic hook that manages:

#### Game State Management:
- **Level Progression**: Tracks current level and unlocked levels
- **Challenge Randomization**: Shuffles challenge order for replay value
- **Scoring System**: Base points + streak bonuses + multipliers
- **Audio System**: Tone.js integration for beat generation
- **Persistence**: Local storage for game progress

#### Key Functions:
- `startGame()`: Initializes audio context and beat intervals
- `stopGame()`: Stops beat generation and audio
- `submitCode()`: Validates user code and updates game state
- `changeLevel()`: Switches between different levels
- `resetGame()`: Complete game reset functionality

#### Scoring Formula:
```
Base Points = 100 (for correct solutions)
Streak Bonus = current_streak * 10
Streak Multiplier = 1 + (current_streak / 10)
Total Points = (Base Points + Streak Bonus) * Streak Multiplier
```

### 4. Achievement System (AchievementsContext.tsx)
Comprehensive achievement and statistics tracking:

#### Player Statistics Tracked:
- `challenges_completed`: Total challenges solved
- `levels_completed`: Levels completed
- `total_score`: Combined game score + achievement points
- `max_streak`: Highest streak achieved
- `perfect_submissions`: Code submissions without errors
- `total_playtime`: Time spent playing (minutes)
- `languages_used`: Array of programming languages used
- `special_counters`: Custom achievement counters

#### Achievement Categories:
1. **Coding Achievements**: Code completion milestones
2. **Rhythm Achievements**: Beat synchronization challenges
3. **Streak Achievements**: Consecutive success requirements
4. **Completion Achievements**: Level and challenge milestones
5. **Special Achievements**: Unique accomplishments

#### Achievement Flow:
1. Player performs action (solves challenge, reaches streak, etc.)
2. `updatePlayerStats()` called with new statistics
3. `checkAchievements()` evaluates all achievements against current stats
4. New achievements trigger notifications and point rewards
5. Achievement points are added to total score (divided by 2 for balance)

### 5. Component Architecture

#### Layout Components:
- **TopBar**: Game controls, score display, streak indicators
- **BeatLine**: Current challenge display, level leaderboard
- **CodeInput**: Code editor with syntax highlighting and validation
- **ProgressTracker**: Player statistics and achievement progress

#### Modal Components:
- **LevelSelector**: Level selection with unlock status
- **LanguageSelector**: Programming language selection
- **Leaderboard**: Global and level-specific rankings
- **DashboardModal**: Comprehensive progress overview
- **AchievementNotification**: Achievement unlock animations
- **ScoreSubmission**: Submit scores to global leaderboard

#### Achievement Data (achievements.ts):
- **Structured Definitions**: Each achievement has requirements, rewards, and metadata
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress calculation for each achievement
- **Rarity System**: Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary achievements

#### Storage Layer:
